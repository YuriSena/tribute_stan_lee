        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><b>Stan Lee</b> (born Stanley Martin Lieber /ˈliːbər/; December 28, 1922 – November 12, 2018) was an
                American comic
                book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business called
                Timely Comics which would later become Marvel Comics. He was the primary creative leader for two
                decades,
                leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that
                dominated
                the comics and film industries.
            </p>
            <p>
                In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writers/artists <b>Jack Kirby</b> and <b>Steve
                    Ditko</b>—he
                co-created iconic characters, including superheroes <b>Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk,
                    Ant-Man, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, the Scarlet Witch,
                    and
                    Black Widow</b>. These and other characters' introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more
                naturalistic approach
                in superhero comics, and in the 1970s Lee challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority,
                indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued the development of Marvel
                properties
                in other media, with mixed results.
            </p>

            <p> Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, Lee remained a public figurehead for the company, and
                frequently made cameo appearances in films and television shows based on Marvel characters on which he
                received an executive producer credit, which allowed him to become the highest grossing person in film
                of
                all time.[2] He continued independent creative ventures into his 90s until his death in 2018. Lee was
                inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall
                of
                Fame in 1995. He received the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.
